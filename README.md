# Pulse-Oxymetry-IC
This project includes the analog-frontend and the digital-backend

************************ Analog-frontend ************************

Signal from dual LED( red led and infrared led) will be amplified through an Op-Amp before it's fed into an ADC.
************************ Digital-backend ************************

Controller written in Verilog to generate control sigals for these above dual LED.
FIR Controller written in Verilog to improve the result.
Guidence:

Open Synopsis Design Vision, import verilog top module to generate Netlist for Controller and FIR filter:
import Top_Module_Controller_and_FIR.v

Open Cadence Encounter, execute the follow file to do floorplan, placement and routing:
